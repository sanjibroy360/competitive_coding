//Simple prime streaming [6kyu]

/*
Consider a sequence made up of the consecutive prime numbers. This infinite sequence would start with:

"2357111317192329313741434753596167717379..."
You will be given two numbers: a and b, and your task will be to return b elements starting from index a in this sequence.

For example:
solve(10,5) == `19232` Because these are 5 elements from index 10 in the sequence.
Tests go up to about index 20000.
*/

// Answer -

const solve = (a, b) => primeString(a + b).slice(a, a + b);

const primeString = (l) => {
  let s = "";
  let i = 1;
  while (s.length < l) s += isPrime(++i) ? i : "";
  return s;
};

const isPrime = (n) => {
  for (let i = 2, s = Math.sqrt(n); i <= s; i++) if (n % i === 0) return false;
  return n > 1;
};
