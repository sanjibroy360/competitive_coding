// My Aunt Sally[6 kyu]

// My aunt Sally is a peculiar woman.She only likes things that have a double letter in them.She dislikes walking but loves running.She also doesnâ€™t like driving but strangely has a passion for steering.

//     Remember, aunt Sally only likes activites that contain adjacent double letter in them(not single or tripple, or more).

// She would like "skiing"

// but she would not like "skiiiing"

// Your task is to return a string of activities, if there are more than one seperate them by a space.

// skiing running

// If there are no activites that aunt Sally likes return an empty string.
